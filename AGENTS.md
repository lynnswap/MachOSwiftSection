# AGENTS.md
This file provides guidance to coding agents when working with code in this repository.

## Documentation

All project documentation lives in the `Documentations/` directory, split by audience (see [`Documentations/README.md`](Documentations/README.md)):

- **`Documentations/` (top level) — external / public docs**, for library users and other developers. Reference-style, English or bilingual (an `*_zh.md` companion). Currently just `SwiftEnumLayout.md` (+ `SwiftEnumLayout_zh.md`).
- **`Documentations/Internal/` — maintainer-facing notes** (design notes, migration guides, refactor write-ups; `Internal/TaskReports/` holds dated per-task reports). This is the default home for working docs.

Name doc files in **PascalCase** with the `.md` extension (e.g. `Internal/SwiftModularizationMigration.md`, `Internal/ReadingContextAbstraction.md`). When asked to "write a doc", default to `Documentations/Internal/` with a PascalCase name — only put it at the top level if it is genuinely a public, externally-facing reference (and then keep it English/bilingual). Do not scatter docs next to source files. When adding or moving a doc, update `Documentations/README.md`.

**Documentation is a first-class deliverable.** Every non-trivial batch of work MUST ship with its documentation in the same push, following this division of labor:

1. **Design doc first** (`Documentations/Internal/<PascalCase>.md`) — written *before* implementation for any substantive feature/refactor; records motivation, decisions, trade-offs, and limitations.
2. **[ProjectEvolutionLog.md](Documentations/Internal/ProjectEvolutionLog.md)** — the chronological ledger of the library's evolution (one section per work arc). Append/update a section at the end of every non-trivial batch: period, motivation, key decisions, landed modules, doc links, version range.
3. **Task report** (`Internal/TaskReports/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`, Chinese) — the per-task retrospective: problem / research / final plan / actual execution / verification / divergence.
4. **Changelog** (`Changelogs/<version>.md`, English) — per release, when `Version.swift` is bumped and tagged (the bump contract in `Version.swift`'s header).

Keeping AGENTS.md's architecture section and `Documentations/README.md`'s index in sync with the code remains part of the same discipline.

## Build and Test Commands

```bash
# Build the project
swift build

# Run all tests (skip IntegrationTests — see note below)
swift test --skip IntegrationTests

# Run specific test suites
swift test --filter DemanglingTests
swift test --filter MachOSwiftSectionTests
swift test --filter SwiftDumpTests
swift test --filter SwiftInterfaceTests
swift test --filter SwiftSectionCommandTests

# Run the CLI tool

```

Requires Swift 6.2+ / Xcode 26.0+.

**Test suite convention:** `Tests/IntegrationTests/` is for the maintainer's manual inspection only — it prints results with no assertions or preconditions. Agents must not run it (use `--skip IntegrationTests` when running the full suite). All other `*Tests` targets have proper assertions and required preconditions, and are safe to run.

## Architecture Overview

This is a Swift library for parsing Mach-O files to extract Swift metadata (types, protocols, conformances). It uses a custom Demangler to parse symbolic references and restore Swift Runtime logic.

`SwiftLayout` (static field-offset engine) is a peer that depends on
`SwiftInspection` + `MachOSwiftSection` (+ `MachOObjCSection` for ObjC-ancestor
instance sizes). It backs the static ABI-analysis path and is consumed by
`SwiftDeclarationRendering`, whose `FieldLayoutRenderer` is reader-specialized:
the `MachOImage` path renders field-offset / type-layout / expanded-tree / enum-layout
comments from in-process runtime metadata, while the `MachOFile` (offline) path
computes the same comments statically through SwiftLayout — so `swift-section dump`
/ `interface` on a file now emit real field offsets without loading the process.
The offline path also renders **generic** types' layouts where SwiftLayout can
resolve them unspecialized (class-bound parameters, parameter metatypes,
generic enums via `enumCaseLayoutResult`), computes payload/enum layouts in the
descriptor's context (`typeLayout(forMangledTypeName:inContextOfDescriptor:)`),
and emits a `Field offset: unknown (<reason>)` comment for a field it genuinely
cannot place (distinguishing "engine cannot know" from "flag off").
See [Documentations/Internal/FieldLayoutRendererReaderSpecialization.md](Documentations/Internal/FieldLayoutRendererReaderSpecialization.md).

### Core Modules

**Demangling** - Custom Swift symbol demangler supporting symbolic references
- `Demangler` - Main demangling logic, parses mangled symbols into `Node` AST
- `Remangler` - Re-mangles nodes back to symbol strings
- `NodePrinter` - Prints nodes as human-readable Swift types
- `Node` - AST representation with `Kind` enum for ~200 mangling node types

**MachOSwiftSection** - Low-level Swift section parsing
- Reads `__swift5_types`, `__swift5_proto`, `__swift5_protos`, `__swift5_assocty`, `__swift5_builtin`
- `MachOFile.Swift` / `MachOImage.Swift` - Entry point via `.swift` property
- Models for descriptors: `TypeContextDescriptor`, `ProtocolDescriptor`, `ProtocolConformanceDescriptor`
- Relative pointer resolution for Swift's position-independent metadata

**SwiftDump** - High-level type wrappers
- `Struct`, `Enum`, `Class`, `Protocol`, `ProtocolConformance`, `AssociatedType`
- `DemangleResolver` - Resolves mangled names using the Demangler

The interface generation is split into layered peer modules over a shared `SwiftDeclaration` base model (`SwiftInterface` orchestrates them):

**SwiftDeclaration** - Shared declaration model (base layer for the Swift* modules)
- `TypeDefinition`, `ProtocolDefinition`, `ExtensionDefinition`, `FunctionDefinition`, names, kinds, `DefinitionBuilder`
- `SwiftIndexEvents` - event namespace (Payload/Dispatcher/Handler) emitted by both indexer and printer

**SwiftIndexing** - Builds the `SwiftDeclaration` model from a Mach-O image
- `SwiftDeclarationIndexer` - Indexes types, extensions, conformances
- `SwiftIndexEventReporter`, `OSLogEventHandler`, `ConsoleEventHandler` - event handlers
- `SwiftDeclarationIndexConfiguration`

**SwiftAttributeInference** - Infers source-level attributes (`@propertyWrapper`, `@resultBuilder`, `@dynamicMemberLookup`, `@objc`, …)
- `TypeAttributeInferrer`, `MemberAttributeInferrer`

**SwiftPrinting** - Renders the `SwiftDeclaration` model as Swift source (depends on `SwiftAttributeInference`)
- `SwiftDeclarationPrinter`, `TypeNodePrinter`, `FunctionNodePrinter`
- `SwiftDeclarationPrintConfiguration`, `SwiftDeclarationMemberSortOrder`
- Type-level members print `class` (not `static`) when they carry a vtable method descriptor (`isClassMember` on `FunctionDefinition` / `VariableDefinition` / `SubscriptDefinition` in `SwiftDeclaration`): mangling cannot distinguish the two spellings, but a `static` member is implicitly final and never gets a descriptor, so `override static` (illegal Swift) is structurally impossible in the output. The four descriptor-less `class` spellings (`final class func`, `class func` in a final class / an extension, `@objc dynamic class func`) are ABI-identical to `static` and conservatively print as the semantically-equivalent `static`. `ClassDumper`'s vtable-section keyword follows the same fact; the dump override-table lines keep the demangler's faithful `static` symbol prefix. See [Documentations/Internal/ClassMemberKeywordRecovery.md](Documentations/Internal/ClassMemberKeywordRecovery.md).
- Specialized definitions (`TypeDefinition.isSpecialized`) render **bound**: the header prints the concrete-argument name (`Box<Int>`, generic-signature clause skipped) via `BoundDumpedTypeNameRenderer`, and each field's type node is substituted through the specialized runtime metadata via `SpecializedMetadataNodeSubstitution` — both live in `SwiftDeclarationRendering` so the dump path (`TypedDumper`, which keeps its own copies/forwarders) stays independent. See [Documentations/Internal/SpecializedInterfaceBoundRenderingRestoration.md](Documentations/Internal/SpecializedInterfaceBoundRenderingRestoration.md).
- The main interface path's stored-field / enum-case rendering (`renderModelFields` → `printThrowingField` / `printThrowingEnumCase`) carries the **pre-leaf-migration error contract**: record reads, metadata comments, and type printing propagate errors (a failing field fails the whole type), and an enum case's payload presence follows the field record's mangled type name (captured at index time as `FieldFlags.hasMangledTypeName`, so rendering never re-reads the record positionally) — a `Void` payload prints `case a()` exactly like the dump path, while a payload whose node *renders empty* degrades to the bare case in both paths (`case a()` around nothing is invalid Swift; the interface printers also render kind-9 accessor-function symbolic references as the honest `accessor function at <offset>` fallback — see [Documentations/Internal/AccessorFunctionReferenceRendering.md](Documentations/Internal/AccessorFunctionReferenceRendering.md)). The diff renderer's `printField` / `printEnumCase` keep their own per-member-catch, rendered-text-gating contract (that is their original design, needed for standalone `+`/`-` members). The shared comment engine's `FieldLayoutRenderer.storedFieldComments` / `enumCaseComments` are `throws` for the same reason, and multi-payload enum descriptors resolve through `MultiPayloadEnumDescriptorCache` in `SwiftDeclarationRendering` (built once per image as a *partial* map — one bad descriptor only degrades its own enum to the tagged projection). See [Documentations/Internal/LeafMigrationRegressionFixes.md](Documentations/Internal/LeafMigrationRegressionFixes.md).

**SwiftSpecialization** - Runtime generic specialization (see implementation plan below)
- `GenericSpecializer`, `ConformanceProvider`
- `TypeDefinition` specialization behavior (`specialize(...)`, `specializedChildren`)

**SwiftInterface** - Thin orchestrator tying indexing + printing into a full interface dump
- `SwiftInterfaceBuilder` - Main builder, call `prepare()` then `printRoot()`
- `.swiftinterface` file types (`SwiftInterfaceFile`, `SwiftInterfaceParser`, …)

Printing and indexing are peers — neither depends on the other.

**SwiftDiffing** - Binary ABI comparison across two or N versions (Mach-O-free: pure value computation over the indexed `SwiftDeclaration` model; depends only on `SwiftDeclaration` + `Demangling`)
- `ABIDiffer` - Two-sided diff: keys every declaration on its remangled `Node` (`ABIKey`), recursive three-way set difference over types / protocols / four extension axes / globals. Extension containers are keyed **per (target, protocol, where fingerprint, retroactive)** — one conformance / conditional block per container (`extensionContainerSnapshots`; attribution frozen at index time onto `ExtensionDefinition.conformingProtocolName` / `genericSignature` / `resolvedAssociatedTypeWitnesses`), so a conformance add/remove is container-level, a where-clause or `@retroactive` change flips identity (removed+added), witness re-binding reports `.modified` (`assocwitness:` namespace), and the historical collision source is structurally gone. `MemberRecord` carries an `identityKey` (match) and a `payloadKey` (change detection: accessor set, field type, enum-case tag + `indirect` flag); a function's signature change is add+remove by design (different mangled symbol = different ABI entry point). `Compatibility` gives an additive/breaking verdict (treats every type as resilient — `@frozen` is not recoverable from the binary). Protocol containers also project their **symbol-stripped requirements** (the OS-framework norm) as `pwtslot:<offset>` records with the requirement flags (kind / isInstance / isAsync / hasDefaultImplementation) in the payload — a PWT-shape change is visible with zero symbols, a mid-table insertion honestly cascades the shifted slots, and stripped-ness being a symbolication state (not an ABI fact) is the documented caveat; the flag facts are Mach-O-free accessors on `StrippedSymbolicRequirement` so the module's `SwiftDeclaration`+`Demangling`-only dependency holds. Diagnostics are **surfaced, not silent**: `ABISnapshot.keyCollisions()` (first-wins key collisions) and `ABISnapshot.remangleFallbacks()` (keys carrying the self-identifying `unmangled:` remangle-fallback prefix, whose removed+added stories may be cross-toolchain identity flips) both ride on `ABIDiff.diagnostics` / `ABIEvolution.keyCollisionsByVersion`+`remangleFallbacksByVersion` + Warnings sections in both reporters
- `ABISnapshot` / `ABISnapshotDocument` - Frozen `Codable` projection + the versioned persistence envelope (`formatVersion` — bump on any key-scheme change, decode fails typed on mismatch; currently 4: v2 folded `indirect` into enum-case keys, v3 split extension containers per conformance, v4 added `pwtslot:` protocol-requirement records and the `unmangled:` fallback prefix — plus `ABIProvenance`: label / binary path / generator version / date). `ABIJSON` is the one JSON dialect (ISO-8601, sorted keys) so baselines are byte-stable
- `ABIEvolution` / `ABIEvolutionBuilder` / `ABIEvolutionReporter` - N ≥ 2 version lineage tracking: builds a key → per-version presence/payload matrix directly (not N−1 pairwise joins), producing per-declaration `ContainerLineage` / `MemberLineage` (presence bitmap + `LineageEvent`s at adjacent transitions). Member events exist only where the owning container is present on both adjacent versions (an added/removed container is the event itself, same rule as `ABIDiff`); for N == 2 the events match `ABIDiffer.diff` exactly (test-pinned). `transitionCompatibilities` extends the verdict per transition
- CLI: `swift-section diff` (change-list / `--json` with provenance / annotated `--interface`; either side may be a snapshot JSON), `swift-section snapshot` (persist a baseline), `swift-section evolution` (N ordered inputs — binaries, dyld caches via `--dyld-shared-cache -n`, or snapshots mixed freely; `--labels`, `--summary-only`, `--json`, `--fail-on-breaking`). Input plumbing shared via `ABISnapshotInputLoader`
- See [Documentations/Internal/ABIDiffDesignAndLimitations.md](Documentations/Internal/ABIDiffDesignAndLimitations.md), [Documentations/Internal/ABIEvolutionDesign.md](Documentations/Internal/ABIEvolutionDesign.md), [Documentations/Internal/PerConformanceAttribution.md](Documentations/Internal/PerConformanceAttribution.md), and [Documentations/Internal/ProtocolRequirementProjection.md](Documentations/Internal/ProtocolRequirementProjection.md)

**SwiftInspection** - Runtime metadata analysis
- `EnumLayoutCalculator` - Predicts enum memory layouts from the runtime's formulas (single-payload XI/overflow, multi-payload spare-bits/tagged). Per-case projections carry `declaredName` (source-level case name), `isPayloadCase`, and a `patternResolution`: `.exactBytes` when `memoryChanges` is authoritative, `.unresolvedExtraInhabitant` when only the extra-inhabitant *index* is known — a formula over the XI *count* cannot recover the concrete bytes (a class reference's XI are small invalid addresses, `String`'s are `_StringObject` discriminator patterns, nested payloads compose recursively), so the offline path renders an honest "not resolved offline" note instead of fabricating patterns. Audited line-by-line against `EnumImpl.h`/`Enum.cpp`/`GenEnum.cpp`/`TypeLowering.cpp` (see [Documentations/Internal/EnumLayoutAuditFixes.md](Documentations/Internal/EnumLayoutAuditFixes.md)): empty cases record the **whole** payload area (tagged zero-extension + spare-bits zero-APInt scatter both fix every payload byte), spare-bits payload cases carry per-byte `fixedBitMasks` (only the common spare bits are fixed — a tag byte shared with live payload storage is never claimed whole, e.g. two-`Bool` payloads), `calculateSinglePayload` takes no `size` (callers cross-check `LayoutResult.impliedTotalSize(payloadAreaSize:)` against the enum's VWT size and discard mismatches), and the runtime backend resolves an `indirect` payload's XI as `heapObjectExtraInhabitantCount` (`INT_MAX` on 64-bit Darwin) — an indirect single-payload enum is an XI layout (`leaf` = null box pointer), not the overflow layout it was once misdescribed as; an unresolvable payload XI is recovered exactly from the enum's own VWT (`payloadXI = enumXI + emptyCases` when payload-sized) or the layout is not rendered at all
- `RuntimeEnumCaseProjector` - Resolves those patterns **exactly** when the enum's metadata is live in-process: dual-baseline (`0x00`/`0xFF`) `destructiveInjectEnumTag` injection diffs out each case's fixed bytes, `getEnumTag` round-trip guards empty cases; the witnesses are invoked through `MachOSwiftSectionC`'s VWT stubs (`swift_section_vwt_getEnumTag` / `swift_section_vwt_destructiveInjectEnumTag`) on every platform — on arm64e the slots are ptrauth-qualified (`__ptrauth_swift_value_witness_function_pointer`, auth-verified at the call, same as the runtime itself), elsewhere the qualifier compiles away, so the host test suite exercises the same stub path. The table pointer itself (the slot one word before the metadata) is PAC-signed on arm64e too (`__ptrauth_swift_value_witness_table`) and is stripped via `stripPointerTags()` before any use (evolution proposal 0004 — the pre-fix raw dereference crashed every genuine arm64e host process; real crash report from RuntimeViewer injecting an App Store binary). Genuine-PAC behavior is verified by `Arm64eSignedVWTPointerTests`: a tagged-slot behavioral test through the real `projectCasePatterns` entry point (runs everywhere, crashed pre-fix) plus canary-gated probes spawned as real arm64e child processes — NOT by running the suite as arm64e, which proves nothing (see the Test Environment note below). Used by `RuntimeFieldLayoutBackend` for single-payload enums via `LayoutResult.applyingExactCasePatterns` (multi-payload patterns come exact from the `__swift5_mpenum` spare-bit mask already); this is what renders `Text.Style.LineStyle`-style comments as `bytes[0x8..<0x10] = 0x1` instead of a placeholder. See [Documentations/Internal/RuntimeEnumCaseProjection.md](Documentations/Internal/RuntimeEnumCaseProjection.md)
- `Transformer.SwiftEnumLayout` (in `OutputTransformer`, bridged here) - Token-template rendering for enum-layout comments: three template levels (strategy line / per-case block / per-fixed-byte line) with `${token}` placeholders, plus five presets — `detailed` (the built-in default, unit-test-guaranteed identical to `EnumCaseProjection.description`, which is implemented over it), `explained` (partially-fixed bytes narrated as bit ranges: `bits 7-4 are always 0100; the other bits (3-0) hold payload data`), `standard` (no per-byte lines), `inline` (one line per case with the byte summary inline after the header: `` Case 1 `implicit` (empty case #0): bytes[0x8..<0x10] = 0x1 ``, via the colon-friendly `${fixedBytesPhrase}` token), `compact` (one line per case, no byte information). `SwiftInspection`'s bridge (`Transformer+EnumLayoutProjection.swift`) builds the template inputs from `LayoutResult`/`EnumCaseProjection`; wiring goes through `applyTransformers` (see the `OutputTransformer` module below) and the CLI's `--enum-layout-style` / `--enum-layout-template` / `--enum-layout-case-template` / `--enum-layout-byte-template`. Conditional content uses line-tokens (`${encodingLine}`, `${patternNoteLine}`) — lines left empty after substitution are dropped; a case template referencing no byte tokens gets the note/byte lines auto-appended (`appendsOmittedDetails`, the historical RuntimeViewer behavior), and a mask-unaware per-byte template never renders a partially-fixed byte (the engine falls back to the mask-scoped built-in wording)
- `ClassHierarchyDumper` - Dumps class inheritance hierarchies
- `MetadataReader` - Reads runtime metadata from MachOImage

**SwiftLayout** - Static aggregate-layout engine (offline field offsets, no runtime)
- `StaticLayoutCalculator` - Entry point: computes struct/class stored-property field offsets from a Mach-O file without loading the process or calling the metadata accessor. `fieldLayout(of:)` lays out a non-generic descriptor; `fieldLayout(of:genericArguments:)` lays out a **concrete generic instantiation** (`Foo<Int>`) by supplying its depth-0 type-argument `Node`s, and `fieldLayout(forInstantiationMangledName:)` does the same from a binary's bound-generic mangled reference (resolving the descriptor in its defining image). All share one environment-threaded per-field path (`accumulateFieldLayout`, default `.empty` ⇒ unchanged non-generic behavior) with per-field degradation
- `StaticTypeLayoutResolver` - Recursive `mangled name → StaticTypeLayout` solver (`Node.Kind` dispatch, memoized, cycle-guarded); class references stop at one pointer
- `BasicLayout` - Offline port of the runtime `performBasicLayout` (struct/class/tuple field accumulation). Also derives the value-aggregate **extra-inhabitant count = max over fields** (`swift_initStructMetadata` "use the field with the most", same rule as tuples) and carries it on `AggregateLayout` so `asStaticTypeLayout()` reports it — previously struct XI defaulted to 0 and was never propagated, which mis-sized any single-payload enum whose payload was a struct with extra inhabitants (e.g. `SwiftUI.Text.Style.TextStyleFont` over `Font`, a struct wrapping a class reference: computed 9 bytes instead of 8, cascading every later `Text.Style` offset). Guarded by `WholeTypeLayoutVsRuntimeTests` (size/stride/alignment of every fixture struct+enum vs the runtime VWT — the offset suite skips enums, so single-payload enum sizes were previously unchecked)
- `KnownLayoutTable` / `BuiltinTypeLayoutIndex` - Frozen stdlib layouts + per-image `__swift5_builtin` whole-type layouts. The builtin section carries the compiler-embedded layout (size/stride/align/XI) of types reflection cannot derive structurally — **imported C value types** (`__C.CGRect`, `__C.Decimal`) and **multi-payload enums** — keyed by the demangled qualified name (the descriptor's `typeName` is a symbolic reference whose raw string is empty). The resolver consults it (per origin image) before its structural struct/enum paths, so those types resolve as opaque whole-type values. The **top-level** entries (`fieldLayout(of:)` / `typeLayout(ofStruct:)`) cross-check a foreign (C-imported) struct descriptor against the same builtin record — Swift field records cannot see C bitfields/padding, so on disagreement the builtin whole-type wins and every field degrades to `.unknown(.foreignTypeFieldOffsetsUnavailable)` instead of reporting confident wrong offsets (`__C.Decimal._mantissa` at 0, really 4; record-less `__C.PathData` as size 0 — found by a SwiftUI/SwiftUICore/SwiftData whole-framework survey vs the live runtime; see `ForeignStructTopLevelLayoutTests`). Frozen `String`/`Character` carry XI `MaxNumExtraInhabitants` (0x7FFFFFFF, the `_StringObject` discriminator's reserved patterns) — a too-small count (the old `1`) broke any single-payload enum with ≥2 empty cases over a `String` payload. **Leaf XI values are now exact runtime counts** (verified against live value-witness tables + IRGen/runtime sources, 64-bit Darwin): managed pointers — class/heap references, container buffer refs, thick metatypes/existential metadata words, C function pointers, blocks, `Unmanaged`/`unowned(unsafe)` — saturate at 0x7FFF_FFFF (`getHeapObjectExtraInhabitantCount`, `LeastValidPointerValue` = 4 GiB); the unsafe-pointer family (`StaticTypeLayout.rawPointer`) reserves only null (XI 1 — the old 0x1000 approximation mis-sized an enum with two empty cases over a raw pointer to 8 instead of 9); thick functions (`StaticTypeLayout.thickFunction`) carry the saturated count on the function-pointer word (the old XI 0 mis-sized `Optional<() -> Void>` to 17 and pushed trailing fields from offset 16 to 24 — a real offset bug); a `weak` **reference word** (`StaticTypeLayout.weakReference`) has XI 0 and is not bitwise-takable; an `unowned` (safe) **reference word** (`StaticTypeLayout.unownedReference`) has exactly XI 1 (ObjC-interop-conservative IRGen `getReferenceStorageExtraInhabitantCount` — note RemoteInspection's `TypeLowering.cpp` wrongly claims it inherits the reference's count) — both are the *word's* values, not the whole field's, since reference storage over a class-bound existential is wider (see the reference-storage bullet below); `Builtin.Word` is an integer (XI 0); an uninhabited (0-case) enum has XI 0 (`SingletonEnumImplStrategy` with no singleton). `WholeTypeLayoutVsRuntimeTests` therefore asserts the full quintuple — size/stride/alignment/**extraInhabitantCount**/**isBitwiseTakable** — against the runtime VWT for every fixture struct+enum
- `EnumLayoutBridge` - No-payload + single-payload (incl. `Optional`) enum layout (runtime `getEnumTagCounts` formulas). Multi-payload enums resolve via the builtin whole-type descriptor first; when absent, `multiPayloadEnumLayout` computes them structurally by reusing `SwiftInspection.EnumLayoutCalculator` (`GenEnum.cpp`/`TypeLowering.cpp` port) over the largest payload + the `MultiPayloadEnumDescriptor` (`__swift5_mpenum`) common spare bits, deriving size/stride itself (`LayoutResult` carries neither) while the extra-inhabitant count comes exact from `LayoutResult.extraInhabitantCount` — computed per strategy inside the calculator (IRGen `getFixedExtraInhabitantCount` for spare-bits/hybrid, the runtime tagged formula, single-payload leftovers), so `Optional<MPE>` wrapping stays exact even on the structural fallback; the official offline implementation (RemoteInspection `TypeLowering.cpp`) never derives spare-bits XI structurally. A **generic** multi-payload enum splits on the compiler's own record: an argument-independent (statically fixed) one — every payload word resolvable without an argument, `Swift.Dictionary.Iterator._Variant` is the canonical case — has its complete spare-bits value-witness table baked into the generic metadata pattern (the runtime never recomputes it, for the unbound form and every instantiation alike) and is exactly the set that gets builtin + `__swift5_mpenum` records (`GenReflection.cpp` gates both on `!needsPayloadSizeInMetadata()`), so the builtin/spare-bits paths accept generic nodes and record presence is the whole discriminator; an argument-**dependent** one gets no records and takes the runtime's tagged `swift_initEnumMetadataMultiPayload` formula (appended tag bytes; the unused tag values become the enum's extra inhabitants — both ported, so `Optional<Environment<Bool>.Content>`-style wrapping stays exact). Cross-image enums also consult the *defining* image's builtin index (enum records are emitted per declaring module). This replaced an earlier (wrong) "generic is always tagged" model that mis-sized the `Dictionary`-iterator-embedding OS types by a tag byte (41/48/XI 254 vs the real 40/40/126) — see [Documentations/Internal/StaticLayoutEngine.md](Documentations/Internal/StaticLayoutEngine.md) and `GenericSpareBitsEnumLayoutTests`
- `ExistentialLayoutBridge` - Existential containers (`any P`, compositions, `AnyObject`, `any Error`) + existential metatypes, ported from the runtime reflection lowering (`ExistentialTypeInfoBuilder`): opaque `32 + 8N`, class-bound `8·(1+N)`, error `8`; class-boundness derived from each protocol's class constraint. Imported ObjC protocols (`any NSCopying`, `__C.<Name>` `.protocol` nodes) are always class-bound and contribute no Swift witness table; **Swift-declared `@objc` protocols** (`SwiftUI.PlatformAccessibilityElementProtocol & NSObject`) emit no Swift protocol descriptor either, so a class-constraint miss falls back to the `__objc_protolist` index (`ObjCProtocolIndex`, legacy `_TtP<module><name>_` names parsed back to qualified names) — a hit is likewise class-bound with no witness table. **Constrained/extended existentials** (`any Boxed<Int>`, encoded via a `symbolicExtendedExistentialType` shape reference) reuse the same container size as the unconstrained form — the shape's inner `ProtocolList` is extracted and routed back through `existentialLayout` (`extendedExistentialLayout`; the requirement list does not affect layout)
- `DependentMemberTypeBridge` - Resolves an associated-type field (`dependentMemberType`, e.g. `struct S<C: Collection> { var i: C.Index }`) reached as a concrete instantiation: after substitution leaves `dependentMemberType(concreteBase, Protocol.Assoc)`, it looks up the conformance's `__swift5_assocty` witness (via `ImageUniverse.resolveAssociatedTypeWitness`, the fourth resolution seam), demangles the witness in the image declaring the conformance, then substitutes the base's own generic arguments into it (`Array`'s `Element` witness is `Array`'s parameter → `Int16`). Degrades when the base is unsubstituted or the conformance's assocty record is reflection-stripped
- `ObjCClassIndex` - Phase-4 Objective-C ancestor support: reads a class's instance `class_ro_t.instanceSize` from `__objc_classlist` (bare name → start layout), resolving the realized `class_rw_t` form for classes dyld has realized in-process. Uses `instanceSize` (where a Swift subclass's first field begins), **not** `instanceStart`; value matches `ObjCClass.info(in:).instanceSize` without parsing methods/ivars. Also indexes every statically-emitted **Swift** class's own `class_ro_t.instanceStart` (legacy `_TtC…` runtime names demangled back to the qualified-name key): the class's field block starts there, slid by the ObjC runtime when the actual ancestor outgrows it (objc4 `moveIvars`: slide rounded up to the class's max own-ivar alignment) — a dyld-cache image carries the pre-slid final value. Classlist membership discriminates the mode: generic / singleton-initialized classes are absent and keep the Swift-runtime rule (exact superclass size, per-field alignment). This fixed the `AppKitTableHeaderCell`-class survey mismatches (fields at 248, not the raw `NSTableHeaderCell` 241; see `ObjCAncestorSlideLayoutTests`). `objc.classes64`/ro accessors are concrete `MachOFile`/`MachOImage` overloads, so the builder is split per reader
- `ObjCProtocolIndex` - Phase-8 `@objc` protocol support: indexes `__objc_protolist` by Swift qualified name (parsing the legacy `_TtP<module><name>_` mangling; native ObjC protocols' plain names are skipped — they demangle as `__C` references and never reach the lookup). Recognition is the whole payload: a Swift-declared `@objc` protocol emits no `__swift5_protos` descriptor, is always class-bound, and contributes no witness table. Reader-split like `ObjCClassIndex`
- `ImageUniverse` / `ImageReference` - Type/protocol/ObjC-class/assocty-witness/ObjC-protocol lookup seam (five resolvers: `resolveType`, `resolveProtocolClassConstraint`, `resolveObjCClassInstanceSize`, `resolveAssociatedTypeWitness`, `isObjCProtocolDeclared`). `ImageReference` indexes one image's type descriptors (`__swift5_types`), protocol class constraints (`__swift5_protos`), ObjC class instance sizes (`__objc_classlist`), associated-type witnesses (`__swift5_assocty`, keyed `conforming|protocol|assoc`), and `@objc` protocol declarations (`__objc_protolist`); `ImageUniverse` is either single-image (`singleImage`) or a **dependency closure** (`dependencyClosure`) that merges a root plus its transitive dependencies, **indexing each dependency lazily** (root eager, dependencies folded in resolution order only when a lookup misses, all five indexes merged together) so a several-hundred-image OS closure is not eagerly demangled
- `ImageUniverse+DependencyClosure` - Closure factories: in-process (`dependencyClosure(root: MachOImage)`, resolves dependencies through the active dyld) and offline (`dependencyClosure(root: MachOFile, searchPaths:)`, resolves through explicit on-disk paths + the dyld shared cache, the latter indexed once by bare name). `LayoutDependencySearchPath` is SwiftLayout-local (no `SwiftInterface` dependency). Dependency load names are matched by **bare name** (`MachOImage(name:)` semantics); `MachOFile.imagePath` is the install name, not a filesystem path
- `GenericArgumentEnvironment` - Phase-5/6 concrete bound-generic field substitution: a non-generic type with a `MyBox<Int>` field resolves it by capturing the instantiated node's `(depth, index) → Node` argument map (`make(forInstantiatedTypeNode:)`) and deep-rewriting the base type's `dependentGenericParamType` field nodes (purely syntactic — no metadata accessor / PWT, so no new `SwiftSpecialization`/`SwiftGenericSupport` dependency). Arguments may be plain types, **value arguments** (`Foo<5>`, bound as `.integer`/`.negativeInteger` nodes, SE-0452), or **flat packs** (SE-0393). Substitution is a hand-rolled **top-down** recursion (not the bottom-up `Node.Rewriter` — pack expansion is context-sensitive: instance `i` of an expansion resolves a pack-bound parameter to its `i`-th element, which a bottom-up pass cannot distinguish from literal packs in shapes like `(repeat Pair<each T>)`): concrete pack expansions expand in place inside `.tuple` (flattened elements, empty pack → empty tuple, single-unlabeled-element result collapses to the element itself, matching the runtime's one-tuple identity) and inside `.pack` literals (the `Foo<repeat each T>` forwarding shape flattens). Only a pack argument still containing an unexpanded expansion degrades the environment. **Arguments are collected per level along the nominal parent chain** (outermost bound-generic level = depth 0), so a nested type of a specialized parent whose fields *use* the parent's parameter — `Environment<Bool>.Content`, a plain `.enum` node with no argument list of its own — binds the parent's arguments, and a two-level instantiation (`Outer<Int8>.Inner<Int64>`) binds each level at its own depth; only parameters of contexts the mangling genuinely does not carry (a local type in a generic function) stay degraded. Instantiations memoize under a remangled instantiation key (`memoizedInstantiationLayout`, skipping the frozen table); a leading bare-name `KnownLayoutTable` check keeps `Array<Int>`/`UnsafePointer<T>` argument-independent. `superclassStartLayout` substitutes the superclass reference first (`class Sub<T>: Base<T>`). Also fixes a latent single-payload-enum bug (the payload reads the correct parameter, not blindly the first type argument). `make(forDepthZeroTypeArguments:)` builds the same depth-0 map directly from a caller-supplied argument-`Node` list (backing `StaticLayoutCalculator`'s top-level generic-instantiation entries), not only from a `boundGeneric*` node. Compiler-enforced simplifications: a generic *type* declares at most one type pack, and enums cannot declare one at all
- `ClassBoundGenericParameterAnalysis` - Phase-9 **unspecialized** requirement-signature layout mining: derives, in one pass over `genericContext.requirements`, the `RequirementSignatureLayoutFacts` a generic descriptor's signature pins about each parameter **without any argument** — both (a) **class-bound parameters** and (b) **concrete same-type pins**. (a) A generic parameter constrained to a class layout (`Element: AnyObject`), a superclass (`Element: SomeClass`, a `baseClass` requirement), or a class-bound protocol (`Element: SomeClassBoundProtocol`, Swift or imported/`@objc` ObjC) is necessarily a single object reference, so a field typed by it — **and every field after it** — lays out exactly even when the type is dumped with no generic arguments; class-boundness is classified from the requirement kind + resolved content (`layout(.class)` / `baseClass` / a class-bound `protocol`; a cross-image protocol symbol is recovered by name through the universe's `resolveProtocolClassConstraint` + `isObjCProtocolDeclared` seams), the parameter rewrites to a placeholder `.class` node the resolver lays out as `.pointerSized` (`swift_getHeapObjectExtraInhabitantCount`, saturated 0x7FFF_FFFF on 64-bit Darwin). (b) A parameter pinned to a **concrete** type by a `sameType` requirement (`Value == Foundation.Date` / `== Range<Int>`, contributed by a **constrained extension** — a type nested in `extension Foo where Value == Date` inherits the requirement) is that type in every valid use, so its unwrapped RHS node becomes a genuine **substitution** (only when the RHS is fully concrete — a `sameType` RHS that references another parameter / dependent member cannot stand alone and is skipped; a dependent-member *subject* like `T.Element == X` says nothing about `T` and is skipped too). Both facts read from bare-parameter subjects carrying absolute `(depth, index)` (matching field records, so nested contexts need no bookkeeping). Seeded via `GenericArgumentEnvironment.augmented(withRequirementFacts:)` at every field-reading entry point (`StaticLayoutCalculator.fieldLayout(ofStruct:/ofClass:)` + the resolver's `computeStructLayout` / `computeClassLayout` / `computeEnumLayout` choke points, so generic superclasses and ObjC-ancestor subclasses benefit too), all through the same top-down substitution (reaching inside optionals/tuples/`Array<Element>`/function types). A genuine instantiation argument always wins over both fallbacks (it cannot contradict a same-type pin). Empirically same-type pinning is small (only ~23 of 579 `sameType` requirements across 5 frameworks are bare-param-to-concrete — 75% are dependent-member subjects the assocty bridge covers, 21% are abstract param-to-param), but it is a correct completion: the two facts together are everything the requirement signature determines without arguments. `sameType`-to-a-concrete-class (a representation-and-value pin) flows through as a substitution just like any other concrete pin. Same-**value** pins (`extension Foo where count == 5` — a `sameType` requirement with `isValueRequirement` set whose RHS mangles an integer) flow through the same extraction with zero extra code: the `.integer` RHS passes the fully-concrete check and binds like a phase-6 value argument, so a nested type's `InlineArray<count, Int16>` field resolves unspecialized (and the interface printer now renders SE-0452 integer nodes — `SwiftPrinting.NodePrintable` previously dropped them, printing `ValueGenericBuffer<>` / `where A == `)
- Fixed arrays / value generics: the resolver dispatches `builtinFixedArray` (`Builtin.FixedArray<count, Element>`: count ≤ 0 → empty; else `size == stride == element.stride × count` with no tail-padding reclamation even at count 1, alignment/bitwise-takability from the element, **XI from the first element** — ported from `swift_getFixedArrayTypeMetadata`, consistent with IRGen `convertBuiltinFixedArrayType` and RemoteInspection `ArrayTypeInfo`), and special-cases `Swift.InlineArray` onto the same formula (layout-identical to its only stored field; its descriptor lives in the stdlib, like `Optional`'s, so single-image scopes work). Tuple XI is the max over elements (runtime `swift_getTupleTypeMetadata` semantics; previously hardcoded 0). Zero-sized fields report offset 0, mirroring the compiler-emitted vector (IRGen `ElementLayout::completeEmpty`), not the accumulator position `performBasicLayout` would report. Note the official offline lowering (RemoteInspection `TypeLowering.cpp`) rejects packs outright — this path is validated directly against runtime substitution semantics
- Reference storage (`weak` / `unowned` / `unowned(unsafe)`) is **not** always one word: the qualifier applies to the *object reference word* only, so a **class-bound existential** referent keeps its witness-table words — `weak var x: (any P)?` is 16 bytes, `any P & Q` 24, while `AnyObject` and an `@objc`-protocol existential (neither carries a Swift witness table) stay 8; `unowned` / `unowned(unsafe)` are the same width. `referenceStorageLayout` strips the `Optional` wrapper and routes an existential referent through the existing `existentialLayout`, keeping a plain class reference / class-bound generic parameter at one word, and degrades to `unknown` when a protocol in the existential cannot be resolved (a wrong width silently shifts every following field). Extra inhabitants split per word — the reference word contributes the qualifier's own count and each witness-table word the saturated pointer count, container takes the max — while bitwise-takability follows the *referent*: an existential's refcounting is unknown (it may hold an ObjC object), so `unowned` (safe) over one lowers to the non-takable unknown-refcounting form, unlike `unowned` over a single Swift class. This was a real offset bug: `SwiftUICore.ViewResponder`'s `weak var host: (any ViewGraphDelegate)?` made the base class 32 bytes instead of 40 and shifted **every field of every subclass** by 8 (`StyledTextResponder.gestureGraph` reported `0x120` for a real `0x128`); it had been masked for a while by the opposite-sign struct-XI bug, whose spurious tag byte happened to cancel it out past a certain field. Note nested `@objc` protocols are still unresolvable (their legacy ObjC name carries the parent context, `_TtPO<module><parent><name>_`, which `ObjCProtocolIndex` does not parse)
- Metatype fields (thin vs thick): a `T.Type` field's storage is decided by the **syntactic kind of the metatype's instance in the field record**, which `GenericArgumentEnvironment.substitute` deliberately leaves un-substituted (a `.metatype` node passes through untouched). A metatype is **thin** (zero-sized, no storage) only when its instance is a statically-concrete value type (struct/enum/tuple/builtin) — IRGen references its metadata directly; it is **thick** (one metadata pointer, `.pointerSized` with the saturated `swift_getHeapObjectExtraInhabitantCount` = 0x7FFF_FFFF) when the instance is a class or a **generic parameter / dependent member** (an archetype). The archetype case is fixed across every instantiation — empirically `Element.Type` occupies 8 bytes in `Foo<Int>` and `Foo<Int8>` alike (IRGen lowers the field once at metadata-pattern time with the parameter as an archetype) — so a generic type's metatype-of-parameter field resolves **exactly without specialization**, and a literal concrete metatype (`Int64.Type`) stays thin even inside a generic type. This replaced an earlier (wrong) model that keyed thinness off the aggregate's genericity; the instance-kind model matches the runtime in both lowering worlds and cleared the survey's residual `metatype(DependentGenericParamType)` degradations
- Per-field degradation: unresolved fields (a top-level generic type's own unsubstituted **non-class-bound** `T`/`each T`/`let N`, depth>0 nested-context parameters, expansions whose count never became concrete) report `FieldResolution.unknown` instead of failing the whole type. Existentials (incl. imported ObjC protocols), the default-actor storage builtin, C-function-pointer / ObjC-block fields, **cross-module field/superclass/protocol types (via the dependency closure)**, **ObjC-ancestor classes** (a Swift class deriving from `NSObject` et al. starts its own fields at the ObjC ancestor's `instanceSize`, located via the closure's libobjc), **multi-payload enums + imported C value types** (via `BuiltinTypeLayoutIndex` whole-type layouts), **concrete bound-generic instantiations as fields** (via `GenericArgumentEnvironment`), **value-generic / parameter-pack instantiations** (`ValueGenericBuffer<5>`, `InlineArray<3, Int64>`, `VariadicPack<Int32, Int8, Int64>`, both as fields and as top-level requests), **associated-type fields** (`C.Index`/`C.Element` of a concrete instantiation, via `DependentMemberTypeBridge` + `__swift5_assocty`), **constrained/extended existentials** (`any Boxed<Int>`), **nested types of a specialized generic parent** (`Outer<Int>.Inner`, whose qualified name keeps the parent chain — including nested types whose fields *use* the parent's arguments, `Environment<Bool>.Content`, via the parent-chain environment), **Swift-declared `@objc` protocol existentials** (via the `__objc_protolist` fallback), and — new in phase 9 — **class-bound generic parameters laid out unspecialized** (`Element: AnyObject` / `: SomeClass` / `: SomeClassBoundProtocol`, via `ClassBoundGenericParameterAnalysis`; the parameter field and everything after it resolve without any argument), **concrete same-type-pinned parameters** (`Value == Date`, from a constrained extension — a real substitution mined from the requirement signature), and **parameter-metatype fields** (`T.Type`, always thick) are resolved; cross-module resilient classes' offsets are computed against the dependency's actual binary ("this specific deployment" semantics). Empirically, over the same 5-framework survey (5416 non-generic types, 10954 fields) the phase-7 fixes cut field degradation from ~10% to ~4%, and the phase-8 fixes (parent-chain arguments + `@objc` protocol fallback) to **0%** — every remaining degradation class requires arguments the binary does not carry. Phase 9 extends coverage to **generic** types dumped without arguments: a class-bound parameter (and a metatype-of-parameter field, always thick) no longer degrades its field. A separate **generic-type survey** (2963 generic types across the same 5 frameworks) measures this second front: of 7255 generic struct/class fields, ~52% resolve unspecialized (every field whose type does not need an argument — concrete fields, class-bound parameters, parameter metatypes, nested class-bound levels), and the residual is dominated by genuinely-argument-dependent `genericParameterUnsubstituted` (bare `T`/`q_`/`qd__`) plus its `precedingFieldUnresolved` cascade. The classes still genuinely unresolvable without specialization are unconstrained or non-class-bound parameters (`T`, `T: Equatable`, value/pack parameters), which need an argument the unspecialized dump has not got

**OutputTransformer** - Output-transformer modules for the **Swift** comment kinds (the `Transformer` namespace RuntimeViewer's settings UI edits; the templates render library-side, RuntimeViewer keeps only the UI via an `@_exported` re-export)
- Token-template comment modules: `SwiftFieldOffset`, `SwiftVTableOffset`, `SwiftMemberAddress`, `SwiftTypeLayout` (optional value-witness-flag inputs render `"unknown"` when the caller cannot know them), `SwiftEnumLayout` (three template levels + presets, see the `SwiftInspection` bridge above)
- `Transformer.SwiftConfiguration` - aggregate settings, hand-written missing-key-tolerant `Codable` (compatible with RuntimeViewer's previously persisted MetaCodable JSON — property names are the storage keys, do not rename them). The ObjC-side modules (`CType`, `ObjCIvarOffset`), `ObjCConfiguration`, and the full persistence aggregate `Configuration` deliberately stay in RuntimeViewerCore for now (declared as extensions of this namespace), pending a library-side home for the ObjC rendering pipeline
- Wiring: `applyTransformers(_:)` on `DeclarationRenderConfiguration` (SwiftDeclarationRendering, where the closure factories live) and `SwiftDeclarationPrintConfiguration` (SwiftPrinting) materializes enabled modules into the existing closure-transformer slots — emission sites unchanged. Dependency-free, so it sits at the bottom of the module graph. See [Documentations/Internal/OutputTransformerMigration.md](Documentations/Internal/OutputTransformerMigration.md)
- CLI: `TransformerOptionGroup` (shared by `dump` / `interface` / `transformer config`) exposes the whole mechanism in three layers, each overriding the previous — `--transformer-config <json>` (decoded straight into `Transformer.SwiftConfiguration`, so a RuntimeViewer-persisted configuration replays verbatim) → `--enum-layout-style <preset>` → per-module template / hexadecimal options (8 template slots across the five modules). A template value containing `${` is literal; otherwise it names a built-in template (`Templates.all`, matched case/space/hyphen/underscore-insensitively) and an unknown name is a `ValidationError` rather than a silently constant comment. **An enabled module turns on the comment kind it renders** (`isEnabled` → `printFieldOffset` / `printVTableOffset` / `printMemberAddress` / `printTypeLayout` / `printEnumLayout`, OR-merged so an explicit `--emit-…` is never turned back off), so passing a template is enough; the reverse does not hold — `--emit-field-offsets` alone still uses the built-in rendering. With no template option the option group returns `nil` and the caller leaves its render configuration untouched, keeping default output byte-identical. `swift-section transformer tokens|templates|config` is the discovery surface; `SwiftSectionCommandTests` (`@testable import swift_section`) pins the resolution and precedence rules. See [Documentations/Internal/CLITransformerTemplateInterface.md](Documentations/Internal/CLITransformerTemplateInterface.md)

**Semantic** - Semantic string building for colored/annotated output
- `SemanticString` - String with semantic type annotations (keyword, type, variable)
- `SemanticType` - Categories: `.keyword`, `.typeName`, `.functionName`, `.variable`, etc.

### MachO Infrastructure Modules

- **MachOFoundation** - Combines reading, symbols, pointers
- **MachOReading** - File reading abstractions
- **MachOResolving** - Address/offset resolution
- **MachOSymbols** - Symbol table parsing and demangling
- **MachOSymbolPointers** - Bind/rebase-aware symbol-or-element slots; its
  unconditional `RelativeIndirectType` witness owns null indirect-slot
  semantics (`OptionalProtocol` element → `.element(.none)`, otherwise
  `ReadingError.invalidAddress(0)`) before any address conversion or read
- **MachOPointers** - Pointer types (relative, indirect, etc.)
- **MachOCaches** - dyld shared cache support
- **MachOExtensions** - Extensions to MachOKit types

### Key Patterns

**Descriptor → Type Wrappers**: Raw descriptors from sections get wrapped:
```swift
let descriptors = try machO.swift.protocolDescriptors
for descriptor in descriptors {
    let proto = try Protocol(descriptor: descriptor, in: machO)
}
```

**Relative Pointers**: Swift uses position-independent relative offsets. The
`RelativeDirectPointer<T>` and related types handle resolution. For indirect
symbol-or-element pointers, do not put nullable behavior in a constrained
overload: calls through `RelativeIndirectPointerProtocol` use the conformance
witness. `SymbolOrElementPointer` therefore handles a zero slot in its single
unconditional witness path; see
[Documentations/Internal/NullIndirectSymbolicReferenceResolution.md](Documentations/Internal/NullIndirectSymbolicReferenceResolution.md).

**Node-based Demangling**: Mangled symbols parse to `Node` trees, then print via `NodePrinter`:
```swift
let node = try demangleAsNode("$sSiD")  // Returns Node tree
let string = node.print(using: .default) // "Swift.Int"
```

## Test Environment

Tests use `MACHO_SWIFT_SECTION_SILENT_TEST=1` to suppress verbose output.

**Pointer-authentication verification trap:** a `swift test` process never enforces pointer authentication, even when built and reported as arm64e (`--triple arm64e-apple-macosx`; auth fixups are strip-applied in that environment, so signed slots read back as bare pointers). Any signature-handling claim "verified because the suite passed as arm64e" is a placebo — verify by spawning a real arm64e child process instead, as `Arm64eSignedVWTPointerTests` does (canary-gated; skipped on hosts without the `-arm64e_preview_abi` boot-arg, e.g. GitHub-hosted runners). See evolution proposal 0004.

Tests read Mach-O files from Xcode frameworks and dyld shared cache for real-world validation.

## Fixture-Based Test Coverage (MachOSwiftSection)

`MachOSwiftSection/Models/` is exhaustively covered by `Tests/MachOSwiftSectionTests/Fixtures/`. Suites mirror the source directory and assert one of:

- **Cross-reader equality** across MachOFile/MachOImage/InProcess + their ReadingContext counterparts (via `acrossAllReaders` / `acrossAllContexts` helpers), plus per-method ABI literal values from `__Baseline__/*Baseline.swift` — this is the standard depth.
- **InProcess single-reader equality** plus per-method ABI literal values (via `usingInProcessOnly` helper). Used for runtime-allocated metadata types (MetatypeMetadata, TupleTypeMetadata, etc.) that have no Mach-O section presence.
- **Sentinel allowlist** with typed `SentinelReason` (in `CoverageAllowlistEntries.swift`). Used for:
  - `pureDataUtility`: pure raw-value enums / flag bitfields with no behavior to test (tests would just be tautologies)
  - `runtimeOnly`: types impossible to construct stably from tests (e.g., `swift_allocBox`-allocated `GenericBoxHeapMetadata`)
  - `needsFixtureExtension`: residual entries deferred by toolchain limits (e.g., `MethodDefaultOverrideTable` requires the not-yet-shipped CoroutineAccessors ABI; canonical-specialized-metadata records need the `-prespecialize-generic-metadata` frontend flag)

`MachOSwiftSectionCoverageInvariantTests` enforces four invariants:
1. Every public method in `Sources/MachOSwiftSection/Models/` has a registered test (or allowlist entry)
2. Every registered test name maps to an actual public method
3. Sentinel-tagged keys' Suites must actually have sentinel behavior (no `acrossAllReaders` / `inProcessContext` references)
4. Sentinel-behavior Suites must be tagged in the allowlist (no silent sentinels)

`SuiteBehaviorScanner` (in `MachOFixtureSupport`) classifies each `@Test func` body by substring presence of `acrossAllReaders` / `acrossAllContexts` / `machOFile` / `machOImage` / `fileContext` / `imageContext` (cross-reader real test) or `usingInProcessOnly` / `inProcessContext` (InProcess-only real test). Helper-call indirection within the same Suite class is recognized via class-scope inheritance.

To add a new public method:

1. Add the method.
2. Run `swift test --filter MachOSwiftSectionCoverageInvariantTests` to see which Suite needs updating.
3. Add a `@Test` to that Suite, using `acrossAllReaders` for fixture-bound types or `usingInProcessOnly` for runtime-only metadata.
4. Append the member name to `registeredTestMethodNames`.
5. Run `swift package --allow-writing-to-package-directory regen-baselines --suite <Name>` to regenerate the baseline.
6. Re-run the affected Suite.

To regenerate all baselines after fixture rebuild or toolchain upgrade:

```bash
xcodebuild -project Tests/Projects/SymbolTests/SymbolTests.xcodeproj -scheme SymbolTestsCore -configuration Release build
swift package --allow-writing-to-package-directory regen-baselines
git diff Tests/MachOSwiftSectionTests/Fixtures/__Baseline__/  # review drift
```

The `regen-baselines` command is provided by the `RegenerateBaselinesPlugin`
SwiftPM command plugin (`Plugins/RegenerateBaselinesPlugin/`). It builds and
invokes the `baseline-generator` executable target. From Xcode you can also
right-click the package → "Regenerate MachOSwiftSection fixture-test ABI
baselines.".

### Environment-drift checks — do these FIRST when snapshot/baseline tests go red

Two environment drifts produce failures that closely mimic real regressions.
Rule out both before attributing red tests to a code change:

1. **Stale fixture binary.** `Tests/Projects/SymbolTests/DerivedData/…/SymbolTestsCore`
   is a gitignored per-machine artifact, while the snapshot `.txt` baselines are
   versioned. A binary older than the fixture *sources* makes snapshot output
   drop whole trailing types with no `Error:` lines (it looks like truncation).
   Diagnose with `strings <binary> | grep -c <TypeName>` for a type added by the
   latest commits touching `Tests/Projects/SymbolTests/SymbolTestsCore`; fix by
   rebuilding with the `xcodebuild` command above (pass
   `-derivedDataPath Tests/Projects/SymbolTests/DerivedData/SymbolTests`).
   Note the binary is shared machine state — a parallel agent session may have
   rebuilt it from a different branch's sources.
2. **Missing local sibling dependencies.** `Package.swift` declares
   `../MachOKit`, `../MachOObjCSection`, `../swift-demangling`, and
   `../swift-semantic-string` as *conditional local path* dependencies: they are
   used when the sibling directory exists, else resolution silently falls back
   to the remote release. A worktree checked out elsewhere (e.g. a scratchpad)
   has no siblings and builds against older remote versions — output drifts
   wholesale (e.g. `T?` printing as `Swift.Optional<T>`), invalidating any
   cross-commit A/B comparison. For historical-baseline experiments, place or
   symlink all four siblings next to the worktree first.

## Work In Progress

### GenericSpecializer (SwiftSpecialization module)

Interactive API for specializing generic Swift types at runtime, living in the `SwiftSpecialization` module.

**Status:** Core implementation complete with tests.

**Key Design Points:**
- Only protocol requirements require Protocol Witness Tables (PWT)
- `baseClass`, `layout`, and `sameType` requirements need validation only, no PWT
- PWT passed in requirement order (critical for correct specialization)
- Generic parameter names derived from depth/index (A, B, A1, B1...) since names not preserved in binary
- Two-step API: `makeRequest()` returns parameters/candidates, `specialize()` executes with user selections
- Uses `ConformanceProvider` protocol to query type conformances from the `SwiftDeclarationIndexer`
- `specialize(...)` / `specializedChildren` are grafted onto the base `TypeDefinition` (in `SwiftDeclaration`) via a cross-module extension; `specializedChildren` is held as an `@AssociatedObject` since an extension cannot add stored properties

**File Structure:**
