/// The set of images the layout engine may resolve types against, plus the
/// resolution entry point the resolver uses to map a fully-qualified type name
/// to its defining image and descriptor.
///
/// The single-image phase builds this with `singleImage(_:)`. The
/// dependency-closure phase adds a root image plus an ordered list of
/// dependency images.
///
/// Indexing is **lazy**: the root is indexed eagerly (it is the binary being
/// laid out), but each dependency is indexed only when a lookup misses every
/// already-indexed image, advancing through the dependency list in order and
/// stopping as soon as the name resolves. A transitive closure of the OS can
/// run to hundreds of images; eagerly demangling every one's type section would
/// cost seconds, whereas real lookups hit an early Swift dependency and index
/// only a handful. A genuine miss (a name defined nowhere) indexes the whole
/// list once, after which every further lookup is `O(1)`.
///
/// Because the resolver only ever calls `resolveType(byQualifiedTypeName:)` /
/// `resolveProtocolClassConstraint(byQualifiedTypeName:)`, neither it nor any
/// layout bridge changes when the universe grows from one image to a closure.
///
/// **Threading contract.** `ImageUniverse` is declared `@unchecked Sendable` so
/// the rest of the layout pipeline (which transitively holds it through a
/// non-`Sendable` `StaticTypeLayoutResolver` and a `StaticLayoutCalculator`
/// struct) can be carried into a `Sendable` holder. The universe itself is
/// **not internally synchronized**: lazy dependency indexing mutates
/// `nextDependencyToIndex` / `typeIndex` / `protocolIndex` / `objCClassIndex`
/// in place during lookups. Concurrent direct sharing is therefore the
/// holder's responsibility — the in-tree owner that needs cross-task safety,
/// `MachOFileStaticFieldLayoutProvider`, funnels every calculator call through
/// one `NSLock` for exactly this reason (see
/// `SwiftDeclarationRendering/StaticFieldLayoutProvider.swift`). If a future
/// caller needs to share an `ImageUniverse` across tasks without that outer
/// lock, push the synchronization down into this class (or convert the
/// pipeline to an `actor`).
