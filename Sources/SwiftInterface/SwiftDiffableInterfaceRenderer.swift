/// Renders a **full Swift interface annotated with diff markers** — a git-diff
/// style view of how the new binary's ABI surface differs from the old.
///
/// It is the rendering analogue of ``ABIDiffer``: where the differ produces a
/// machine-readable change list, this produces the *whole* interface (every
/// declaration, changed or not) with each line classified as `added` (`+`),
/// `removed` (`-`), or `unchanged` (a space). It is structure-driven — the
/// shared ``InterfaceUnionWalker`` walks the two indexed models as a 2-version
/// axis, matches declarations on the same `ABIKey` the differ uses, and emits
/// each member from its own per-member printer so a single member's lines can
/// carry its own marker. A modified member shows as its old line (`-`)
/// immediately followed by its new line (`+`). The two-sided presentation
/// itself lives in ``DiffUnionStrategy``.
///
/// The renderer deliberately produces a *classified* stream — a block-grouped
/// `[[DiffLine]]` — and never bakes a diff symbol in. How a ``DiffMarker``
/// becomes concrete output (git-diff prefixes, a unified-diff hunk, HTML, …) is
/// the job of a ``DiffFormat``; ``printAnnotatedInterface(format:)`` defaults to
/// ``DiffFormat/inline``, which emits the git-diff-style `+`/`-`/` ` line prefix
/// at column 0 followed by a one-space gutter so column 0 is dedicated to the
/// marker and content always starts at column 2.
///
/// Surface is FULL: public, package, internal, and private declarations are all
/// rendered (private discriminators kept). Access-level splitting is a future
/// refinement, not a filter.
///
/// Build two ``SwiftDiffableInterfaceBuilder``s, `prepare()` each, then hand them
/// here. The two binaries may be different `MachO` types (e.g. a standalone
/// dylib vs a dyld-cache image), so the renderer is generic over both — the
/// generic parameters are erased at construction (each side becomes an
/// `InterfaceVersionUnit`), so they carry type-checking meaning only.
