/// Runs a library entry point on the demangler's large-stack task executor
/// (evolution proposal `large-stack-executor-and-cross-version-parallelism`).
///
/// `StackSafeExecutor` decides per demangle / print / remangle whether to hop
/// to an 8MB pool thread by probing the CALLING thread's remaining stack, not
/// its identity. Swift Concurrency's cooperative threads (and libdispatch's)
/// carry 512KB, so on them the probe never passes and every call pays a
/// thread round trip plus a semaphore wait — 8–21 µs each in release, 1.14–2.28×
/// the work itself. The synchronous indexing sweep amortizes that with one
/// `withLargeStack` batch (`SymbolIndexStore.buildStorageImpl`); an `async`
/// print loop cannot be enclosed in a synchronous batch. The upstream answer
/// (swift-demangling proposal 0014, shipped in 0.6.3) is a `TaskExecutor`
/// whose threads carry 16MB: a task running on it passes the probe at every
/// entry point, synchronous callees included, so the whole pipeline runs
/// inline with zero hops.
///
/// ``run(_:)`` is the one place this library adopts it. The async entry points
/// — indexer preparation, interface building and printing, the printer's
/// per-definition entries, diff / evolution preparation and rendering, and
/// the dump family — wrap their bodies in it, so a host gets the executor
/// without changing a line. Nesting is free: a task already on the executor
/// does not switch, so an entry point reached from another wrapped entry
/// point pays nothing.
///
/// Output is identical either way; only the thread the work runs on differs.
/// Where the runtime has no task executors (below macOS 15 / iOS 18 / tvOS 18
/// / watchOS 11 / visionOS 2, or off Darwin) the body runs unchanged on the
/// caller's executor — the pre-adoption behavior, hops included.
///
/// Two upstream contracts the wrapping honors: an unstructured `Task {}`
/// does not inherit the preference (SE-0417), so the library starts none
/// inside a wrapped entry point (child tasks and default actors do inherit);
/// and a job that blocks its thread waiting on another job of the same
/// quality-of-service class can exhaust that class's workers, exactly as it
/// would exhaust the cooperative pool — which is why cross-version
/// parallelism caps its window at the processor count.
