// Vtable slot attribution — deciding which member a slot belongs to.
//
// The answer comes from the method descriptor's OWN `Tq` symbol, not from the
// symbols sitting at its implementation address. The implementation route is
// not invertible: identical code folding merges every byte-identical function
// body onto a single address, and asking the index which symbols live there
// answers with all of them at once. SwiftUICore's `0x9330` — the empty `ret`
// body — carries 2878, which is how `SwiftUI.GraphHost`'s four empty vtable
// methods came to print as one correct name plus three coroutine resume
// functions belonging to its nested `GraphHost.Data` struct.
//
// A `Tq` method-descriptor symbol is a data symbol at the descriptor's own
// address, one per member, so folding cannot reach it. Evolution proposal 0006
// already relied on that property as negative evidence for the `final` keyword
// (a member with a `Tq` symbol provably owns a vtable entry); this is the same
// fact used positively.
//
// It is not always available — a stripped image, or a member whose descriptor
// symbol the compiler never emitted — so every entry point here returns `nil`
// rather than throwing, and callers fall back to the implementation route.

// joins on the subclass's member symbols, so a parent-shaped node matches
// nothing and the `override` keyword disappears from the output entirely
// (caught by `SymbolTestsCoreE2ETests.outputContainsOverrideKeyword`).
// Override slots keep the implementation-address route, which is correct for
