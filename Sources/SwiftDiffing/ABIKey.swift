import Demangling

/// A stable, version-independent identity for a Swift declaration, derived by
/// *remangling* its demangled `Node` back into a canonical symbol string.
///
/// Swift name mangling encodes a declaration's full ABI contract — module,
/// parent context, name, parameter/return types, throws/async, generic
/// signature. Two builds where a declaration's `ABIKey` is unchanged carry the
/// same ABI for that declaration; a changed key marks an ABI change. Remangling
/// is total over the declarations we key (every member carries a `Node`), so no
/// Mach-O is needed — keys are pure functions of the indexed model.
///
/// Note on the two roles: `MemberRecord` uses `ABIKey` both as a matching
/// *identity* and as a change-detection *payload*, and for entities with no
/// symbol (stored fields, enum cases) it carries a namespaced `.printed` source
/// key rather than a true mangled identity. So `ABIKey` is best read as "the
/// canonical comparison token for a declaration", of which the remangled symbol
/// is the preferred form. (TODO(P2): consider splitting identity vs payload key
/// types if the overload becomes confusing.)

    /// The remangled symbol string — the preferred, signature-complete form.
    case mangled(String)

    /// A fallback rendering used when a node cannot be remangled
    /// (`mangleAsString` throws). It is prefixed with the node's root kind and
    /// printed with bound-generic arguments retained, so that `struct Foo` vs
    /// `class Foo` and `Box<Int>` vs `Box<String>` stay distinct even on the
    /// fallback path.

    ///
    /// Known limitation — `.mangled` and `.printed` are distinct cases that never
    /// compare equal, so the branch is part of the identity. Remangling is
    /// deterministic for a given node, so this is stable when both sides present
    /// the *same* node. But if the two binaries emit structurally different
    /// demangle trees for what is the same declaration (e.g. built with different
    /// toolchains) and one tree remangles while the other throws, the identity
    /// flips `.mangled`↔`.printed` and the declaration surfaces as removed+added
    /// rather than modified. Narrow — it needs the rare throw path on exactly one
    /// side — and a structural tree difference usually *is* a real change, so the
    /// behavior stands; what changed is observability: fallback keys carry the
    /// `unmangled:` prefix, `ABISnapshot.remangleFallbacks()` collects them, and
    /// the reporters surface them as warnings. (A remangle-success-independent
    /// identity would rework the key for a precision loss — still not worth it.)
