/// `IndexerConformanceProvider`'s subclass map must not lose a class silently.
///
/// Since evolution proposal 0002 the map build materializes each class wrapper
/// from its descriptor (the superclass reference can live in the wrapper's
/// trailing objects). That read can throw — before the proposal the wrapper was
/// a stored property and could not — and the `catch` it landed in had been
/// written for the `superclassNode` read alone. A class whose wrapper cannot be
/// materialized therefore dropped out of the map with no event, no diagnostic
/// and no error, and `subclasses(of:)` narrowed a specialization search by a
/// candidate that had quietly gone missing.
///
/// The two causes are now caught separately: an unreadable wrapper is reported,
/// an absent / unreadable superclass link stays silent (that is the ordinary
/// "this class has no usable parent" case, which most classes take).
