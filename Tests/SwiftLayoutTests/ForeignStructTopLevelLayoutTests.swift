/// that contradicts the authoritative `__swift5_builtin` whole-type record
/// (which the *field-type* resolution path already consults): `__C.Decimal`'s
/// records place `_mantissa` at 0 (really 4) and size the type 16 (really 20).
/// Discovered by a SwiftUI/SwiftUICore/SwiftData whole-framework survey against
/// the live runtime; `__C.PathData`-style record-less foreign structs came out
/// as size-0 aggregates through the same gap.
