///
/// Two independent ground truths back the assertions:
///   - `DistributedActorTest` has a non-empty runtime field-offset vector
///     (`[16, 112, 128]`), so its closure-computed offsets are checked against
///     the runtime accessor — a fully automatic cross-module validation that
///     also exercises resolving a cross-module struct field
///     (`Distributed.LocalTestingActorID`).
///   - The two resilient subclasses have an *empty* runtime vector (their field
///     offsets are computed at runtime and stored only in the live metadata,
///     with no static `…Wvd` field-offset global emitted), so they are pinned
///     to literals derived from the cross-module parent's statically-computed
///     instance size: `ResilientBase` is a Swift root class with one stored
///     `Int` → instance size 24, so `ResilientChild.extraField` is at 24;
///     `Object` is an empty Swift root class → instance size 16, so
///     `ResilientObjCStubChild.stubField` is at 16.
/// Declares `SymbolTestsHelper` even though it never names the fixture case:
/// the dependency closure below reaches that binary by a hand-built path, which
/// is precisely why its sharing with `SwiftIndexingTests.PerImageCacheEvictionTests`
/// went unnoticed. That suite asserts on the per-image caches this one populates,
/// so both must declare the exclusion — one-sided is no exclusion at all.
