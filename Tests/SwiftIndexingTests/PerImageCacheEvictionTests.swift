/// The indexer's `deinit` cleans up three per-image caches (symbol store,
/// interned-name store, demangle memo). Two rules govern that cleanup:
///
/// 1. It is performed by the image's **LAST** live indexer — an earlier
///    indexer deinitializing while a second one still uses the same image must
///    not wipe the caches out from under it (the survivor's already-built names
///    would keep an orphaned store alive while new names land in a fresh one,
///    splitting the `store ===` fast paths for the rest of its lifetime).
///    PR #103 review, finding M6.
/// 2. Each cache is claimed **separately**. The symbol store is the only one an
///    indexer necessarily builds; the interned-name store and the demangle memo
///    are also populated by SwiftLayout, `SwiftDeclarationRendering` and
///    `SwiftSpecialization`. A single combined claim sampled from the symbol
///    store alone evicted caches that non-indexer work had built and was still
///    using — the follow-up round of the same finding.
///
/// Runs against `SymbolTestsHelper` under `ExclusiveImageAccess`, which
/// serializes every suite declaring that image — including ones in other test
/// targets. The prose this replaces claimed the image was one "no other suite
/// indexes", which was false: `SwiftLayoutTests.DependencyClosureLayoutTests`
/// resolves through the same binary, reaching it by a hand-built path rather
/// than through `MachOFileName`, so searching for the fixture case could not
/// find it. Without the exclusion these assertions race that suite's indexing —
/// in both directions, since clearing the caches here splits an interned store
/// it is reading mid-resolution.
///
/// `.serialized` on top of that is still needed, but for a different reason: it
/// orders tests *within* this suite, so a previous test's residue does not
/// decide the claims under test. It does nothing across suites — its own
/// documentation says it "does not affect the execution of a test relative to
/// its peers or to unrelated tests".
