/// The diff renderer's header contract: a declaration whose HEADER cannot be
/// rendered must be dropped whole, never rendered as a body under a blank
/// header line.
///
/// The historical defect: while header rendering swallowed a throw into an
/// empty `SemanticString`, the body was assembled anyway, producing a type's
/// members and braces with NO `struct Foo` / `protocol Foo` line above them —
/// structurally invalid Swift, emitted silently, with no event and no error.
/// Today `DiffUnionStrategy.resolveTypeHeader` / `resolveProtocolHeader`
/// return `nil` on an all-sides failure and the walker skips the body whole.
///
/// Header rendering can genuinely throw: it reads the declaration's name,
/// generic signature and superclass and demangles each (issue #102 is the field
/// evidence that print-time `DemanglingError`s occur on real binaries), and
/// since evolution 0002 it also re-materializes the wrapper from its
/// descriptor.
