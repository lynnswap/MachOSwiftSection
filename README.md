# MachOSwiftSection

A Swift library for parsing mach-o files to obtain Swift information.
（Types/Protocol/ProtocolConformance info）

It may be the most powerful swift dump you can find so far, as it uses a custom Demangler to parse symbolic references and restore the original logic of the Swift Runtime as much as possible.

> [!NOTE]
> This library is developed as an extension of [MachOKit](https://github.com/p-x9/MachOKit) for Swift

### Swift Package Manager

Add the package to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/MxIris-Reverse-Engineering/MachOSwiftSection", from: "0.10.0"),
],
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "YourTarget",
        dependencies: [
            .product(name: "MachOSwiftSection", package: "MachOSwiftSection"),
            // Optional higher-level products:
            .product(name: "SwiftInspection", package: "MachOSwiftSection"),
            .product(name: "SwiftDump", package: "MachOSwiftSection"),
            .product(name: "SwiftInterface", package: "MachOSwiftSection"),
            .product(name: "TypeIndexing", package: "MachOSwiftSection"),
        ]
    ),
]
```

| Product | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `MachOSwiftSection` | Low-level parsing of `__swift5_*` sections (raw descriptors). |
| `SwiftInspection` | Runtime metadata inspection — `EnumLayoutCalculator` (multi-payload enum layouts), `ClassHierarchyDumper`, `MetadataReader`. |
| `SwiftDump` | High-level type wrappers (`Struct`, `Enum`, `Class`, `Protocol`, `ProtocolConformance`, …). |
| `SwiftInterface` | End-to-end Swift interface generation. |
| `TypeIndexing` | Index types / extensions / conformances for cross-binary analysis. |

### Usage

#### Basic

Swift information from MachOImage or MachOFile can be retrieved via the `swift` property.

```swift
import MachOKit
import MachOSwiftSection

let machO //` MachOFile` or `MachOImage`

// Protocol Descriptors
let protocolDescriptors = try machO.swift.protocolDescriptors
for protocolDescriptor in protocolDescriptors {
    let protocolType = try Protocol(descriptor: protocolDescriptor, in: machO)
    // do somethings ...
}

// Protocol Conformance Descriptors
let protocolConformanceDescriptors = try machO.swift.protocolConformanceDescriptors
for protocolConformanceDescriptor in protocolConformanceDescriptors {
    let protocolConformance = try ProtocolConformance(descriptor: protocolConformanceDescriptor, in: machO)
    // do somethings ...
}

// Type/Nominal Descriptors
let typeContextDescriptors = try machO.swift.typesContextDescriptors
for typeContextDescriptor in typeContextDescriptors {
    switch typeContextDescriptor {
    case .type(let typeContextDescriptorWrapper):
        switch typeContextDescriptorWrapper {
        case .enum(let enumDescriptor):
            let enumType = try Enum(descriptor: enumDescriptor, in: machO)
            // do somethings ...
        case .struct(let structDescriptor):
            let structType = try Struct(descriptor: structDescriptor, in: machO)
            // do somethings ...
        case .class(let classDescriptor):
            let classType = try Class(descriptor: classDescriptor, in: machO)
            // do somethings ...
        }
    default:
        break
    }
}
```

#### Generate Complete Swift Interface

For generating complete Swift interface files, you can use the `SwiftInterface` library which provides a more comprehensive interface generation capability.

```swift
import MachOKit
import SwiftInterface

let builder = try SwiftInterfaceBuilder(configuration: .init(), eventHandlers: [], in: machO)
try await builder.prepare()
let result = try await builder.printRoot()
```

Generated interfaces reflect a wide range of Swift language features:

- Type / member attributes: `@objc`, `@nonobjc`, `dynamic`, `@retroactive`, `@globalActor`, `@escaping`, `consuming` / `borrowing` parameter modifiers
- `distributed actor` declarations and `distributed func` members
- `deinit` for classes and noncopyable types
- VTable offset comments alongside class members, ordered to match the on-disk layout
- Expanded field offsets for nested struct fields, rendered as a tree
- Inverted protocols (`~Copyable`, `~Escapable`) on types and generic requirements

#### Inspect Runtime Metadata

`SwiftInspection` exposes higher-level inspection utilities built on top of `MachOSwiftSection`:

- `EnumLayoutCalculator` — compute the on-disk layout of Swift enums, including single-payload and multi-payload (tagged and untagged) cases. Mirrors the ABI rules in `swift/ABI/Enum.h`.
- `ClassHierarchyDumper` — walk a class's inheritance chain across Swift/ObjC boundaries (requires `@_spi(Internals) import SwiftInspection`, `MachOImage` only).
- `MetadataReader` — demangle types, symbols, context descriptors, and build generic signatures against a Mach-O.

## swift-section CLI Tool

### Installation

You can get the swift-section CLI tool in three ways:

- **GitHub Releases**: Download from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/MxIris-Reverse-Engineering/MachOSwiftSection/releases)
- **Homebrew**: Install via `brew install swift-section`
- **Build from Source**: Build with `./build-executable-product.sh` (requires Xcode 26.0 / Swift 6.2+ toolchain)

### Usage

The swift-section CLI tool provides six subcommands: `dump`, `interface`, `diff`, `snapshot`, `evolution`, and `transformer`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of 0.10.0, when the input is a fat / universal binary you must pass `--architecture <arch>`. The tool no longer picks a default slice silently.

#### dump - Dump Swift Information

Dump Swift information from a Mach-O file or dyld shared cache.

```bash
swift-section dump [options] [file-path]
```

**Basic usage:**
```bash
# Dump all Swift information from a Mach-O file
swift-section dump /path/to/binary

# Dump only types and protocols
swift-section dump --sections types,protocols /path/to/binary

# Save output to file
swift-section dump --output-path output.txt /path/to/binary

# Use specific architecture (required for fat binaries)
swift-section dump --architecture arm64 /path/to/binary
```

**Static memory-layout comments (computed offline, no process loaded):**
```bash
# Field offsets for struct/class stored properties
swift-section dump --emit-field-offsets /path/to/binary

# Field offsets + per-field type layout (size / stride / alignment)
swift-section dump --emit-field-offsets --emit-type-layout /path/to/binary

# Expand nested struct fields with their absolute offsets
swift-section dump --emit-expanded-field-offsets /path/to/binary

# Enum layout (strategy / per-case / spare bits)
swift-section dump --emit-enum-layout /path/to/binary

# Enum layout with a different comment style — detailed (default), explained
# (bit ranges in plain words), standard (no per-byte lines), inline (one line
# per case with the byte summary), or compact
swift-section dump --enum-layout-style explained /path/to/binary
```

**Header and export-status annotations:**
```bash
# Leading header block: generator, image path, UUID, architecture,
# library-evolution detection (dispatch-thunk count), and a short digest of
# facts the binary provably cannot recover (IUO spelling, @available, …)
swift-section dump --emit-header /path/to/binary

# Annotate member-symbol lines whose symbol (including its Tj/Tq/Tu derived
# forms) has no export-trie entry — a symbol-table fact, not an access-level
# guess. Override implementation symbols and @objc members are exempt (they
# are reachable through the parent's dispatch thunk / objc_msgSend without
# any exported symbol of their own). Nothing is emitted when the image
# carries no export information.
swift-section dump --emit-export-status /path/to/binary
```

Every comment kind above can also be reformatted with your own template — see
[transformer](#transformer---customize-comment-formats). Passing a template
option implies the matching `--emit-…` flag.

These offsets are computed statically by the `SwiftLayout` engine — no runtime,
no metadata accessor, no loading the binary into a process — so they work on any
on-disk Mach-O file (including resilient classes and cross-module field types,
resolved through the dependency closure over the dyld shared cache, as well as
value-generic and parameter-pack instantiations such as `InlineArray<5, Int8>`
or `Variadic<Int, String>` fields). The
`interface` command's `--emit-offset-comments` / `--emit-expanded-field-offsets`
flags use the same static engine.

**Working with dyld shared cache:**
```bash
# Dump from system dyld shared cache
swift-section dump --uses-system-dyld-shared-cache --cache-image-name SwiftUICore

# Dump from specific dyld shared cache
swift-section dump --dyld-shared-cache --cache-image-path /path/to/cache /path/to/dyld_shared_cache
```

Dump output includes richer annotations:

- Protocol witness table (PWT) entries are annotated with the requirement they satisfy
- Inverted protocol constraints (`~Copyable`, `~Escapable`) are rendered on types and generic requirements
- Protocol conformances can include the PWT address

#### interface - Generate Swift Interface

Generate a complete Swift interface file from a Mach-O file, similar to Swift's generated interfaces.

```bash
swift-section interface [options] [file-path]
```

**Basic usage:**

```bash
# Generate Swift interface from a Mach-O file
swift-section interface /path/to/binary

# Save interface to file
swift-section interface --output-path interface.swiftinterface /path/to/binary

# Use specific architecture (required for fat binaries)
swift-section interface --architecture arm64 /path/to/binary
```

**Static memory-layout comments:**

```bash
# Field offsets (and PWT offsets) on the generated interface
swift-section interface --emit-offset-comments /path/to/binary

# Per-field type layout (size / stride / alignment) and enum layout
swift-section interface --emit-type-layout --emit-enum-layout /path/to/binary
```

These use the same static `SwiftLayout` engine as `dump`, and accept the same
comment-template options — see
[transformer](#transformer---customize-comment-formats).

**Header and export-status annotations:**

```bash
# Leading header block ahead of the imports: generator, image path, UUID,
# architecture, library-evolution detection (dispatch-thunk count), and a
# short digest of facts the binary provably cannot recover
swift-section interface --emit-header /path/to/binary

# Annotate members none of whose symbols (including Tj/Tq/Tu derived forms)
# have an export-trie entry with a `// not exported` comment. `override` and
# `@objc` members are exempt — they are reachable through the parent's
# dispatch thunk / objc_msgSend without any exported symbol of their own.
swift-section interface --emit-export-status /path/to/binary

# Print only the declarations the image exports — the filtering counterpart of
# --emit-export-status. Types and protocols are ruled by their descriptor
# symbol's export-trie entry, extensions by whether their target is an
# in-image non-exported declaration, members by the same derived-form verdict
# the annotation uses. Still a symbol-table fact, never an access-level guess:
# anything without export evidence (and every `override` / `@objc` member) is
# kept, so an `-enable-testing` build keeps its `internal` declarations.
swift-section interface --exported-only /path/to/binary
```

All three flags default to off, keeping default output byte-identical.

**Working with dyld shared cache:**

```bash
# Dump from system dyld shared cache
swift-section interface --uses-system-dyld-shared-cache --cache-image-name SwiftUICore

# Dump from specific dyld shared cache
swift-section interface --dyld-shared-cache --cache-image-path /path/to/cache /path/to/dyld_shared_cache
```

#### diff - Compare the ABI of Two Versions

Diff the Swift ABI of two versions of the same module at the **binary** level — field retypes, enum-case tag renumbering, accessor changes, added/removed conformances — details a `.swiftinterface` diff cannot see. Extension changes are attributed **per conformance / per conditional block** (`Target: Protocol where …`), so adding or dropping a single conformance reads as one container-level change. Protocols whose requirement symbols are stripped (the OS-framework norm) still diff by their **witness-table slots**, so a protocol gaining or losing a requirement is visible with zero symbols; compare binaries in similar strip states, since a symbol-rich vs stripped pair reports the same requirement as a member swap.

```bash
# Change-list report with a breaking/backward-compatible verdict
swift-section diff old/Foo.framework/Foo new/Foo.framework/Foo

# Either side may be a persisted baseline produced by `snapshot`
swift-section diff baseline.json new/Foo.framework/Foo

# Machine-readable output / CI gating
swift-section diff old.dylib new.dylib --json
swift-section diff old.dylib new.dylib --summary-only --fail-on-breaking

# Full interface annotated with +/- diff markers (needs two binaries)
swift-section diff old.dylib new.dylib --interface --format unified
```

#### snapshot - Persist an ABI Baseline

Index a binary once and freeze its ABI into a versioned JSON baseline; later diffs and evolution runs can consume the JSON without the original binary.

```bash
swift-section snapshot /path/to/binary --label 1.0 -o baseline-1.0.json

# From a dyld shared cache image
swift-section snapshot --dyld-shared-cache -n SwiftUICore /path/to/dyld_shared_cache --label 26.0 -o swiftuicore-26.0.json
```

#### evolution - Track ABI Across Many Versions

Track one module's ABI across an ordered series of versions (oldest first) and report each declaration's lifeline: introduced / modified / removed / re-added, with a per-transition additive-or-breaking verdict. Inputs mix freely between binaries, dyld shared caches, and `snapshot` baselines.

```bash
# Three OS versions of the same framework, one report
swift-section evolution 17.0.json 18.0.json /path/to/Foo-26.0.dylib --labels 17.0,18.0,26.0

# Across dyld shared caches (extracts the same image from each cache)
swift-section evolution --dyld-shared-cache -n SwiftUICore cache-17 cache-18 cache-26

# Summary or JSON, and CI gating on any breaking transition
swift-section evolution v1.json v2.json v3.json --summary-only --fail-on-breaking
swift-section evolution v1.json v2.json v3.json --json
```

With `--interface`, the same axis renders as a single **annotated union
interface** instead of the lineage list: every declaration that ever existed
appears once (rendered from the last version that has it), declarations that
changed carry a trailing `// [●●○] removed in 26.0`-style comment (presence
bitmap + event phrases; the legend at the top maps bitmap positions to version
labels), and declarations present throughout with no changes stay bare. A
member whose signature changed shows its newest generation, with the old shape
in the comment (`modified in 26.0: old → new`). Because the interface renders
from live models, every input must be a binary or dyld shared cache in this
mode — snapshot JSON inputs are rejected.

```bash
# The union interface with lifecycle annotations, colorized on a terminal
swift-section evolution --interface v17/Foo.dylib v18/Foo.dylib v26/Foo.dylib --labels 17.0,18.0,26.0

# Across dyld shared caches, written to a file, gating CI on breaking changes
swift-section evolution --interface --dyld-shared-cache -n SwiftUICore cache-17 cache-18 cache-26 --fail-on-breaking -o SwiftUICore-evolution.swift
```

#### transformer - Customize Comment Formats

The memory-layout comments `dump` and `interface` emit are rendered from token
templates. Each of the five comment kinds — field offset, vtable offset, member
address, type layout, enum layout — has its own template, its own `${token}`
placeholders, and a set of built-in templates you can name. This subcommand
lists them and builds reusable configurations; the template options themselves
are accepted directly by `dump` and `interface`.

```bash
# What can a template say?
swift-section transformer tokens                        # every module
swift-section transformer tokens --module enum-layout   # one module

# Built-in templates — their names are accepted by the template options
swift-section transformer templates --module field-offset
```

**Using a template.** Pass either a built-in template name or a literal
template containing `${token}` placeholders. A name that matches nothing is an
error rather than a silently constant comment.

```bash
# Built-in template by name: "// 0x0 ..< 0x10"
swift-section dump --field-offset-template range /path/to/binary

# Literal template: "// @0x0"
swift-section dump --field-offset-template '@${startOffset}' /path/to/binary

# Enum layout is three templates: strategy line, per case, per fixed byte
swift-section dump \
    --enum-layout-template strategyOnly \
    --enum-layout-case-template inlineSummary \
    /path/to/binary
```

Passing any template option enables the comment kind it formats, so no separate
`--emit-…` flag is needed. Numbers can be switched between hexadecimal and
decimal per module (`--field-offset-hex` / `--no-field-offset-hex`, and so on).

**Reusable configurations.** A whole set of templates can be frozen into a JSON
file and replayed with `--transformer-config`. The file format is the one
RuntimeViewer persists, so a configuration tuned in its settings UI works here
unchanged.

```bash
# Freeze a command line into a file
swift-section transformer config \
    --field-offset-template range \
    --enum-layout-style compact \
    --output-path comments.json

# Replay it
swift-section dump --transformer-config comments.json /path/to/binary
swift-section interface --transformer-config comments.json /path/to/binary
```

## Running Tests

The snapshot tests in this repository rely on a fixture framework (`SymbolTestsCore`) built from an Xcode project in `Tests/Projects/SymbolTests/`. The framework binary is not checked in — rebuild it once after cloning:

```bash
./Scripts/build-test-fixtures.sh
```

Then run the tests:

```bash
swift package update
swift test
```

Skipping the fixture build causes `MachOFileTests` to throw a "file not found" error at `Tests/Projects/SymbolTests/DerivedData/.../SymbolTestsCore` during test `init()`, before any assertions run.

To regenerate snapshots after a legitimate Swift-compiler / metadata change:

```bash
SNAPSHOT_TESTING_RECORD=all swift test \
    --filter SymbolTestsCoreDumpSnapshotTests \
    --filter SymbolTestsCoreInterfaceSnapshotTests
```

Commit the updated `__Snapshots__/` files alongside the source change that prompted the regeneration.
